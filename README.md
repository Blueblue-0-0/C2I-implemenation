# GPyTorch & Gaussian Process Experiments

This workspace is set up for experimenting with GPyTorch and implementing various Gaussian Process (GP) models in Python.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (already done):
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
   If you see a script execution error, run:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
3. Install required packages (already done):
   ```powershell
   pip install torch gpytorch numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
- Start coding your GP models in this environment.
- Use Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts as needed.

## Notes
- You can install additional packages as required for your experiments.
